# StudyNest
This program is designed to help students track, plan, and manage their study sessions. This software will use a mix of data visualization, scheduling, and productivity techniques. This way a user can stay focused and analyze how they will spend their study hours by tracking their study time. When using StudyNest, users can create new tasks under the to-do list tab, once a task is created they can delete, undo, or check off the task. There is also a timer where users can set the timer for how long they want to study. Lastly, there is also a stats dashboard where it shows your total completed tasks, total study sessions, and the current streak for how many days you have studied for. It also shows a chart of your study progress.
